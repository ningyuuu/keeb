        Hello! I’m Ning, and I build custom keyboards on commission for clients.<br /><br />
        As a software engineer, most of my waking hours are spent in front of a computer. <span
          class="font-semibold">Typing on a keyboard that feels and looks good matters to me.</span><br /><br />
        I found <span class="font-semibold">most “gaming” keyboards to be overpriced and underwhelming</span>, so I
        decided to build my own.<br /><br />
        Now, I would like to share my passion with the community at <span class="font-semibold">reasonable
          prices</span>.
        I am proud of the effort and care I put into the keyboards I build.
